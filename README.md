# Deepfake Audio Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust deepfake audio detection system capable of identifying manipulated audio content generated using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Deepfake audio poses a significant threat as it can be used to spread misinformation, impersonate individuals, and manipulate public opinion. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and audio processing techniques, our goal is to create a reliable solution for detecting deepfake audio and differentiating it from authentic recordings.

## Features
Audio Preprocessing: Implement preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of audio samples and extract relevant features for analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning architectures to classify audio samples as real or fake.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the detection system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Real-time Integration: Integrate the trained model into existing audio verification systems or develop standalone applications for real-time deepfake detection.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with visualization tools for analyzing detection results and facilitating user interaction.

## Usage
### Data Collection:
Gather diverse datasets containing both authentic and manipulated audio samples.
### Preprocessing:
Preprocess the audio data to extract relevant features and standardize the format.
### Model Training: 
Train the deep learning models on the annotated dataset using transfer learning or from scratch.
### Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using validation datasets and appropriate evaluation metrics.
### Integration:
Integrate the trained model into real-world applications or deploy standalone detection systems.

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
