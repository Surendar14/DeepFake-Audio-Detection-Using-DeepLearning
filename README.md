# Deepfake Audio Detection Using DL

Creation of a deepfake audio detection system using machine learning to distinguish between authentic and manipulated audio recordings, aiming to combat the spread of misinformation and cyber fraudulent.



# About
This project aims to develop a robust deepfake audio detection system capable of identifying manipulated audio content generated using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Deepfake audio poses a significant threat as it can be used to spread misinformation, impersonate individuals, and manipulate public opinion. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and audio processing techniques, our goal is to create a reliable solution for detecting deepfake audio and differentiating it from authentic recordings.

# Features

Implement preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of audio samples and extract relevant features for analysis.
### Machine Learning Models: 
Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning architectures to classify audio samples as real or fake.
### Evaluation Metrics: 
Evaluate the performance of the detection system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
### Real-time Integration:
Integrate the trained model into existing audio verification systems or develop standalone applications for real-time deepfake detection.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with visualization tools for analyzing detection results and facilitating user interaction.
